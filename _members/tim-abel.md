Born in Cologne, Germany, I finished my masters degree in DÃ¼sseldorf and graduated with my PhD in Berlin. While I originally studied Biochemistry, I ventured off into Biophysics early during my education. Since then I have pioneered advanced imaging techniques designed to offer new perspectives on classical questions in molecular biology and biochemistry.


I combine genetic engineering, functional assays and multi-color live-cell single molecule imaging to observe and analyze protein complexes, their interactions, and reactions in their native environment. I believe that modern imaging techniques combined with quantitative image analysis can reveal the world of cellular biology on a molecular scale, helping us to understand systems that are too dynamic or complex for classical approaches.


Biologically, I am interested in protein quality control and targeted protein degradation, both processes that ensure a healthy and undamaged proteome in any eukaryotic cell. I aim to understand how these processes are coordinated in space and time, which requires the cooperation of a variety of complex molecular machinery including the proteasome, p97 and the ubiquitination machinery.
