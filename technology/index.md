# <u>Technology</u>

Our lab is interested in the way that single macromolecules, experiencing only the laws of physics in their local environment, are collectively orchestrated to give rise to living, self-maintaining systems. We primarily work on the dynamic, structurally complex membranes of subcellular organelles, which host crucial machinery for the regulation and coordination of nearly every major process of life in both health and disease.
